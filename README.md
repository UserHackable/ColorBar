## LED Color Bar

This is intended to be used to light up a glass sculpture or etching on glass or plexiglass. 

The usb level shifting components would theoretically allow you to control the colors over the USB port, but I haven't goten around to trying that yet. 

The small oval LED's are CREE 4mm ovals
